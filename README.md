I'm doing AOC because I want to learn C. I find this a great tool to keep me interested and to
practice whatever techniques I learn along the way.

I am, as of this writing, just starting to learn to code, so, the code will be inefficient,
horrible, and just generally filled with bad practices and errors. I expect things will be improving
in time.
